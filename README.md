Our Team was given the Project creating a pixel perfect clone of SUGAR Cosmetics and we were given a week’s time to complete the project.
We were excited and a bit nervous at the same time as we had to complete everything within a given time frame.
Being patient and focused helped us a lot to figure out what to do and how exactly to apply all the learnings that we did in this unit. 
By Planning and dividing the work efficiently we started our work.

* Project Details:-
> SUGAR Cosmetics is an Indian e-commerce company, founded by Vineeta Singh (Co-founder and CEO) and Kaushik Mukherjee (Co-founder and COO) in 2015, with its headquarters in Mumbai. It focuses on selling makeup and skincare products

* Landing Page :
>
This is the main landing page of our website. Here clicking on any option on the Navbar will redirect the user to the respective Page. Here the user can search for the required products using the Live Search.
In the top section, there is a Header that displays the Dropdown menu of pages.
At the bottom section, there is a footer, both Header & Footer are the same across all the pages.

* Register/Login Page :
> Existing user can Login and new user’s can Register themselves.
Here the User can Register themself onto the website and experience a smooth purchase simply by verifying their number using OTP.

* Products and Services:-
> * Product page:
On the navbar, we have different categories like Makeup, brushes, skincare, etc. So when we click on the desired page for example makeup, will redirect us to the respective page. This makeup page had three sub-categories like Lips, Face, and Eyes.They all have a few common features as,

> * Items can be filtered according to the Price
Add Item to Wishlist or Cart
Update or Delete Item

* Cart page:
> This is the cart page, On this page, you can see all products that have been added to the cart with the total price. From here you either can increase /decrease quantity or you can remove the respective product from the cart


* Payment page:
> After finalizing items users can go to checkout and choose any payment method, on placing an order.

# Challenges:-

We had faced a lot of issues in cloning the website. We faced some issues in merging cart data to the cart sidebar on all pages. But after some time we are able to do it. We also sometimes had to fix some issues related to merging our code through the git hub.

> Now answering the big question of how we did it, I would like to say that it is because of the effort that everyone put in. I and my wonderful teammates had, we able to achieve our goal. As part of Masai school, we have always believed that communication and skills are greater than knowledge so it is because of effective communication and sheer will to understand complicated things and make them simple to understand, that we were able to create the page with comparatively fewer resources.
